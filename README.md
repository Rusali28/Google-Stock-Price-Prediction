## Google-Stock-Price-Prediction

This is an implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory models to learn and predict the stock prices of Google, taken over a range of time.

## Recurrent Neural Networks

These are the kinds of neural networks in which we pass the feedback of one layer to the previous layers in a cycle, unlike feedforward neural networks, where propagation of data and learned parameters occurs in only one direction. 
These networks are helpful for remembering short term information.
The shortcoming of RNNs:
1. Vanishing Gradients
2. Exploring Gradients
